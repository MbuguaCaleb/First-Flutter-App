**What is Flutter**

```
(a)It is a google UI Toolkit for building natively compiled apps for mobile,web and desktop.

(b)With it you can build IOS and Android apps using a single codebase.

(rather than tradiitonal router whether you have a java or kotlin codebase for your android app and a separate codebase for your ios app with swift.)

(c)Cross Platform-Mac/windows/linux

(d)It is extremely  fast.

{IT IS Faster than web based technologies  eg reactNative,Nativescript and
Ionic }

It is faster because it does not have that extra javascript bridge to the OEM user
Interface.

Flutter uses the native archutecture arm binary which makes flutter faster than all
of its competitors.


```

**The Dart Programming Language**

```

(a)Flutter uses an OOP language called dart.

(b)Dart brings in an optimized UI

(c)Fast on all platforms

(d)Similar to javascript with elements of java.

Flutter widgets are like components in react .

Every widget has got a build method which is similar to render in react.

```
In any object-oriented programming language, Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.

```
